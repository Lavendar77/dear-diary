## About DearDiary

DearDiary is a personal diary app that I developed to test my Laravel skills :)

It is basically a CRUD app, where you register and;
- Write about your day, choose a category for it (Work, Study, Personal, etc.), and save.
- Edit and delete your entry whenever you choose.

## Considerations

Thank you for checking this out! Please bear in mind, I created this November 2018 when I finished my tutorials on Laravel.
Laravel is cool, and I hope to increase my knowledge and get bigger projects very soon ;)

## Installation
The database still uses the default name and password [homestead], please remember to check through; like I said, I just had to do something.

THANKS
